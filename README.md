# Multimodal Test Case Generation Tool

This application uses a multimodal language model (LLM) to describe testing instructions for digital product features based on user-uploaded screenshots. The system allows users to drag and drop images of digital product interfaces, which are uploaded to Cloudinary. The image URLs are then sent to OpenAI's GPT-4 API, which generates test cases for the features depicted in the screenshots.

## Features
- **Drag-and-drop image upload**: Users can drag and drop screenshots of digital products.
- **Cloudinary integration**: Uploaded images are stored in your Cloudinary media library, and their URLs are retrieved.
- **Automated test case generation**: GPT-4 processes the image URLs to generate detailed test case instructions based on the screenshots.

## Technology Stack
- **Front-end**: React
- **Back-end**: Node.js
- **Cloud storage**: Cloudinary
- **Multimodal LLM**: GPT-4 API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **React** (v17 or later)
- **Cloudinary Account**: Set up a Cloudinary account and obtain API keys.
- **OpenAI API Key**: You'll need an OpenAI API key to interact with GPT-4.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. **Install dependencies** for both the front-end and back-end:
    - For the **frontend**:
      ```bash
      cd frontend
      npm install
      ```
    - For the **backend**:
      ```bash
      cd ../backend
      npm install
      ```

### Configuration

#### Cloudinary Setup
1. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add your Cloudinary credentials:
    ```env
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
    ```

#### OpenAI Setup
1. In the `.env` file in the `backend` folder, add your OpenAI API key:
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server**:
    ```bash
    cd server
    nodemon server.js
    ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm start
    ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access the tool.

### Usage
1. **Drag and drop**: In the app's interface, drag and drop screenshots of the digital product.
2. **Upload and generate**: Once images are uploaded, click the "Describe Testing Instructions" button to generate test cases.
3. **View test cases**: The test cases generated by GPT-4 will be displayed below the images.
